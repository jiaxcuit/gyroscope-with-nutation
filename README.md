# gyroscope-with-nutation
Part of our summer project.

The file 'simulation.m' is for plotting the graphics.
The file 'solve_ode.py' is for solving for the angle that describes nutation as a function of time.
The output from 'solve_ode.py' needs to be added to 'simulation.m' manually if physical parameters of the gyroscope is changed.
