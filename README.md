# gyroscope-with-nutation
Part of our summer project. A MATLAB simulation of a gyroscope with precession and nutation. 

The file 'simulation.m' is for plotting the graphics.

The file 'solve_ode.py' is for solving for the angle that describes nutation as a function of time.

The output from 'solve_ode.py' needs to be added to 'simulation.m' manually if physical parameters of the gyroscope is changed.

This MATLAB simulation has been developed based on [the code by Toplizhuo](https://github.com/Toplizhuo/gyroscope_simulation). This simulation is a collaborative work of me and my teammates.
